# Network_Based_Method_for_Tournaments_Prediction

This project focuses on developing a graph-based approach for modeling and predicting match outcomes in international football tournaments. The proposed methodology incorporates graph theory, centrality scores, and random walk techniques to analyze the relationships between football clubs and national teams and generate predictions for match results. The model utilizes the FIFA club ranking scores as covariates to determine the influence of each team in the tournament. By assigning centrality scores to the participating teams, the model identifies the favorite team with the highest score. The random walk approach, utilizing normalized club ranking scores as transition probabilities, calculates the probabilities of each team winning a match. The research demonstrates the effectiveness of the model by achieving an accuracy score of 60.41\% in predicting match outcomes in the FIFA World Cup 2022 and 54.90\% in the Euro 2020 competition. These results highlight the model's ability to provide valuable insights into match outcomes and its potential to assist in betting strategies and tournament analysis. Moreover, the study suggests that combining the proposed model with statistical or advanced machine learning approaches can further enhance the accuracy of match predictions. The findings contribute to the field of sports analytics and provide a foundation for future research in the domain of football tournament prediction and analysis.
